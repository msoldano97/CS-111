*****************************************************************************
* PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:
* In this assignment, you will be creating an application for Vehicle Inventory, 
* which will keep track of a companyâ€™s collection of Vehicles, which include 
* Boats and Cars.  You will be creating 3 classes to represent this data: 
* Vehicle.java, Boat.java and Car.java.  For our purposes, Vehicle will be 
* the abstract base (parent) class and Boat and Car will be the concrete
* derived (child) classes.
*****************************************************************************
* ALGORITHM:
* 1. Maintains an array of Vehicles (Vehicle[])
* 2. Creates 2 Boat objects (you provide the data for each object) and adds them to the array
* 3. Creates 2 Car objects (you provide the data for each object) and adds them to the array
* 4. Loop through the array and display each of the objects to the console.

*****************************************************************************
* ALL IMPORTED PACKAGES NEEDED AND PURPOSE:
* none
