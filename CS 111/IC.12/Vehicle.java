*  IC12_AbstractVehicleInheritance
*****************************************************************************
* PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:
* In this assignment, you will be creating an application for Vehicle Inventory, 
* which will keep track of a companyâ€™s collection of Vehicles, which include 
* Boats and Cars.  You will be creating 3 classes to represent this data: 
* Vehicle.java, Boat.java and Car.java.  For our purposes, Vehicle will be 
* the abstract base (parent) class and Boat and Car will be the concrete
* derived (child) classes.
*****************************************************************************
* ALGORITHM:
* 1. Make Vehicle an abstract class (cannot be instantiated).
* 2. Create instance variables for manufacturer (String) and year (int).  
* **Be sure that all instance variables can be inherited by the two child classes**
* 3. Create accessors/mutators for all instance variables.
*****************************************************************************
* ALL IMPORTED PACKAGES NEEDED AND PURPOSE:
* none
